/**
 * Persona-Driven UX Evaluation System
 * 
 * This demonstrates how the enhanced system provides persona-specific feedback
 * that goes beyond generic UX evaluation to reflect each user type's unique
 * perspective, language, and priorities.
 * 
 * Enhanced Features:
 * 1. Persona-specific evaluation lenses and critical questions
 * 2. Authentic communication styles and vocabulary
 * 3. Typical concerns each persona would notice
 * 4. Context-aware evaluation criteria (mobile/desktop/flow)
 * 5. Satisfaction indicators specific to each user type
